## Troubleshooting

### Windows Defender/SmartScreen Prompts

Windows Defender or SmartScreen may show a warning when you run the installer or the application for the first time. This is because the application is not yet signed with a trusted certificate. To proceed, click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

### Profiles File

The application stores all the profiles in a JSON file located at `%APPDATA%\RealityBuilder\profiles.json`.
